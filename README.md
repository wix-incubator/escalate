# Escalate
[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/escalate.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/escalate)

A generic logger / error reporting facade. Can apply different loggers to different logging contexts, and escalate logging into runtime errors.

It is said that most problems in the computer science can be solve by adding the right amount of indirection. Escalate provides a way (of inderction) to intervene and decide what to do with logging and throwing errors. This allows you test how non functional code behaves. 
## Usage
In your code:
### Logging
```es6
import {getMailBox} from 'escalate';
const MAILBOX = getMailBox(context);
```
where ```context``` can be anything you want to use to identify the logging events from that specific instance.
Usually, that would be a string namespace in dot notation, like ```'my.beautiful.library'```.
Naming the instance ```MAILBOX``` is a code convention that will allow future tools to filter some logging invocation from the code before producing a production version.
then issue reports like so:
```es6
MAILBOX.error(`Something unexpected happened: ${message}`);
```
or like so:
```es6
MAILBOX.post('error', misMatchMessage(errorContext,fieldDef,fieldDef.defaults(),path));
```
supported logging levels: ```debug, info, warn, error, fatal'```
By default, the ```debug``` level is ignored, and the ```error``` and ```fatal``` levels will throw an error.
### Configuring
You can configure the behavior by using the ```config``` method:
```es6
import {config} from 'escalate';
config(configuration);
```
The ```configuration``` object may have any of 4 optional methods:
```es6
{
  loggerStrategy : (context) => logger
  panicStrategy : (context) => panic
  logThresholdStrategy : (context) => logThreshold
  panicThresholdStrategy : (context) => panicThreshold
}
```
The ```logger``` type has 4 mandatory handler methods, named```debug, info, warn, error'```. By default, this will be used:
```es6
let logger = {
  error : (...params) => console.error(...params),
  warn : (...params) => console.warn(...params),
  info : (...params) => console.info(...params),
  debug : (...params) => console.info(...params) // some environments don't have console.debug
};
```
The ```panic``` type is a method that will be called whenever a logging event that passes the panic threshold occures. for example:
```es6
function panic(...params){
  throw new Error(params.join(' '));
}
```
```logThresholdStrategy``` and ```panicThresholdStrategy``` are methods that accept a context and return a logging level (string). 
Any log event that is below the logging threshold returned by ```logThresholdStrategy``` will be ignored at runtime, while any log event that is equal or above the logging threshold returned by ```panicThresholdStrategy``` will escalate to the panic returned by ```panicStrategy```.
